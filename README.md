# puzzlio

This project is a puzzle game designed to assess soft skills. The game requires players to solve a series of puzzles that test their problem-solving, critical thinking, and communication skills.

## Soft Skills Assessed

The puzzle game is designed to assess the following soft skills:
- Written communication
- Language skills
- Logical aptitude	
- Curiosity

Players will be evaluated based on time taken by them to solve different puzzles.  
The game is designed to provide a challenging and engaging way to assess these skills.

## Puzzle Solving Strategies

There are 3 doors in the game.  
Door 2 leads to the completion of puzzle, while the last puzzles in door 1 and door 3 are dead ends.  
But one must complete atleast half of the puzzles in door 1 and door 3 to access door 2.  
(Hints and answers can be viewed for each puzzle in the app, if the player is stuck.)
